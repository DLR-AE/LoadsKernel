    "## Simulation Set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation set-up for the maneuver loads simulation is very similar to the set-up done for the trim analyses. The only difference is in the self.trimcase set up. In this case two extra maneuvers are included. The three maneuvers used for the trim cases were used: the horizontal level flight (n<sub>Z</sub>=1), the push-down maneuver (n<sub>Z</sub>=-1) and the pull-up maneuver (n<sub>Z</sub>=2.5). Additionally, two roll maneuvers were added. From CS-25 Amendment 28 {cite}`cs25`, the aircraft at trim with a 30◦ bank angle has to be able to roll to a 30◦ bank angle in the other direction in not more than 11 seconds. That corresponds to a roll velocity of p=5.45◦/s. A roll velocity of p=5.45◦/s is actually quiet slow and it does not produce very interesting results in the maneuver loads. For that reason, this roll maneuver is going to be performed in 3 seconds rather than 11. Hence, a roll velocity of p=20◦/s. All these maneuvers were performed at True Airspeed (TAS) of 70m/s and Flight Level FL000. This trim velocity was chosen again because is roughly the middle point between the maneuvering speed V<sub>A</sub>=113KEAS=58.13m/s and the design speed for maximum gust intensity V<sub>B</sub>=170KEAS=87.46m/s."

    "The resulting nodal loads were integrated at designated monitoring stations along the wing span to derive section loads, utilizing the <em>Loads Kernel</em>. In this section only the <em>Loads Kernel</em> results are analysed, since in the previous section the verisimilitude between <em>MCS Nastran</em> and <em>Loads Kernel</em> was proved. A total of 16 monitoring stations were strategically placed on each wing. Key quantities of interest for the wing include the bending moment M<sub>x</sub>, torsional moment M<sub>y</sub>, and shear force F<sub>z</sub>.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the critical load cases, two-dimensional load envelopes were constructed, illustrating combinations of two significant section loads. For the wing, the pertinent load envelopes are F<sub>z</sub>/M<sub>x</sub> and M<sub>x</sub>/M<sub>y</sub>  . But only the M<sub>x</sub>/M<sub>y</sub> load envelope is going to be analysed. Given the wing’s configuration with an outboard section featuring sweep and a rectangular inboard section, section loads were computed in the global coordinate system (x-y-z directions: aft-right-up) for the inboard section, and in a local coordinate system for the outboard section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, next figure illustrates the load envelope detailing the torsional moment M<sub>y</sub> and bending moment M<sub>x</sub> at the wing root. It is evident that the most significant negative bending moment M<sub>x</sub> aligns with the pull-up maneuver, while the highest positive bending moment M<sub>x</sub> corresponds to the push-down maneuver. Similarly, regarding the torsional moment M<sub>y</sub> , the peak negative torsional moment M<sub>y</sub> coincides with the pull-up maneuver, and the maximum positive torsional moment M<sub>y</sub> aligns with the push-down maneuver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it’s noticeable that the roll maneuvers exhibit identical bending moments M<sub>x</sub> to horizontal level flight since the load factor remains constant at n<sub>Z</sub>=1 for all three maneuvers. However, in terms of the torsional moment M<sub>y</sub> , the roll maneuvers display an offset (one for each side) compared to horizontal level flight. This outcome was anticipated as the roll maneuver involves aileron deflection, contributing to an increase in elastic wing twist.\n",

    "Moreover, one-dimensional envelopes along the wing span provide insights into the evolution of section loads across the wing. Next figure illustrates the envelope of the bending moment M<sub>x</sub> along the wing span, with each red dot denoting the highest positive and negative bending moment at each monitoring station. A comparison between the results for the right and left wings reveals symmetrical bending moments with reversed signs, attributable to the rearward orientation of the x-axis in the coordinate system for both sides. In the left wing, the most significant negative bending moment arises from the pull-up maneuver with a load factor of n<sub>Z</sub>=2.5. Conversely, the largest positive bending moment stems from the push-down maneuver with a load factor of n<sub>Z</sub>=-1. Hence, a negative sign denotes an upward bending moment, while a positive sign indicates a downward bending moment. Conversely, for the right wing, the opposite occurs due to the definition of the x-axis. This outcome aligns with expectations, as the pull-up maneuver induces upward wing bending, while the push-down maneuver leads to downward bending. The highest bending moments M<sub>x</sub> are at the root as expected.\n",
