There will be two new files in the output folder: \"response_\\*.hdf5\" and \"monstations_\\*.hdf5\". In the response, all results are stored, such as the trim solution, the aerodynamic forces, the structural deformations, the nodal forces on the structure, etc. Depending on the model size and number of load cases, the file may become very large, especially for time domain simulations. Therefor, the second file only includes the section loads calculated at the monitoring stations. "
