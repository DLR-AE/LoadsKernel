# Loads Kernel Tutorials

While the User Guide {cite}`vos_loads_2020` mainly describes the theoretical background, this collection of tutorials focuses on how to use the software. This collection of tutorials include a short introduction on how to use <em>Loads Kernel</em>, a detailed simulation set-up, and the simulations and results of the trim, maneuvers and gust loads, and the flutter check simulations.

The aeroelastic model of the Douglas DC3 as well as most parts of this tutorial are created by Francisco Carvalho during his master thesis {cite}`Carvalho2024`.
